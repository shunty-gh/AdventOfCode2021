# Advent of Code 2021

## C# solutions

A few solutions written in C# for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles.

Written using .Net 6 and the new 'minimalist' approach (esp. for Program.cs).

### Pre-requisites

* [.Net 6 installed](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
* (Optional) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - the build and run/debug tasks work with VS Code
* (Optional) Any other C# code editor, notepad, IDE, environment, cloud, whatever you so desire

### Run

```
$> cd cs
$> dotnet run
```

At the moment you can't choose different days - it just runs anything/everything specified in Program.cs

### Debugging

The `.vscode` directory contains a launch configuration to debug the program in Visual Studio Code. Make sure to select the `.NET Launch` option from the debug pane and then press F5 to run/debug.
