# Advent Of Code 2021

Some code to help find solutions to the [AdventOfCode 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

Currently:
* TypeScript solutions - see the [README](./ts/README.md) for details.
* Python - maybe. See how we get on. [README](./py/README.md) for details.

All code will, hopefully, run cross platform - Windows, Linux, Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL2) and likely Mac but not tested.

Most code is written using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on a combination of Windows desktop, WSL2, remote SSH to Ubuntu 20 and an occasional Docker container. Just for variety.
