Some solutions written in Python for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles. This may or may not be a complete set depending on will power.

Written using Python 3.x

#### Pre-requisites

* Python 3 installed - duh
* (Optional) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - the build and run/debug tasks work with VS Code
* (Optional) Any other Python code editor, IDE, environment you so desire

### Run

```
$> python3 day01.py
```

Change `day01` to whatever day number is required - if it's been completed/coded.

### Debugging

The `.vscode` directory contains a launch configuration to debug the currently active window in Visual Studio Code - assuming it is a Python script. Make sure to select the `Python: Curent File` option from the debug pane and then press F5 to run/debug.
